# Entities

Entities are the graphical objects in dxf.

:::note

All entities described here are added directly to the model space block.

:::

All Entities have some common options:

- `trueColor`
- `colorNumber`
- `layerName`
- `visible`
- `lineType`
- `lineTypeScale`

## `ARC` entity

An arc is a portion of the circumference of a circle.
(See more in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_arc))

```js
import DxfWriter, {point3d, addArc} from '@tarikjabiri/dxf';

const dxf = new DxfWriter();

dxf.addArc(point3d(0, 0, 0), 10, 0, 45);
// or
const myArc = addArc(point3d(0, 0, 0), 10, 0, 45); // If you want a reference to the added arc.
```

## `CIRCLE` entity

A circle is a shape consisting of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre.
Equivalently, it is the curve traced out by a point that moves in a plane so that its distance from a given point is constant.
The distance between any point of the circle and the centre is called the radius. (From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle))

```js
import DxfWriter, {point3d, addCircle} from '@tarikjabiri/dxf';

const dxf = new DxfWriter();

dxf.addCircle(point3d(0, 0, 0), 10);
// or
const myCircle = addCircle(point3d(0, 0, 0), 10); // If you want a reference to the added circle.
```

## `ELLIPSE` entity

An ellipse is a plane curve surrounding two focal points, such that for all points on the curve, the sum of the two distances to the focal points is a constant.
As such, it generalizes a circle, which is the special type of ellipse in which the two focal points are the same.
(From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse))

```js
import DxfWriter, {point3d, addEllipse} from '@tarikjabiri/dxf';

const dxf = new DxfWriter();

dxf.addEllipse(point3d(100, 100, 0), point3d(50, 0, 0), 0.5, 0, 2 * Math.PI);

// or if you want a reference to the added ellipse.
const myEllipse = addEllipse(point3d(100, 100, 0), point3d(50, 0, 0), 0.5, 0, 2 * Math.PI); 
```

## `3DFACE` entity

A 3d face is flat surface with 4 corners.

```js
import DxfWriter, {point3d, add3dFace} from '@tarikjabiri/dxf';

const dxf = new DxfWriter();

dxf.add3dFace(
	point3d(0, 0, 0),
	point3d(0, 100, 0),
	point3d(100, 100, 0),
	point3d(100, 0, 0)
);

// or if you want a reference to the added face.
const my3dFace = add3dFace(
	point3d(0, 0, 0),
	point3d(0, 100, 0),
	point3d(100, 100, 0),
	point3d(100, 0, 0)
);
```
You can contole the visibilty of the edges of the 3d Face by using the convenience methods:

```js
my3dFace.setFirstEdgeVisible(true);
my3dFace.setSecondEdgeVisible(true);
my3dFace.setThirdEdgeVisible(true);
my3dFace.setFourthEdgeVisible(true);

//Or all of them at once
my3dFace.setEdgesVisible(true)
```
> By default all of them are visible.

Also you can set the visibilty in the options:
```js
import DxfWriter, {point3d, add3dFace, InvisibleEdgeFlags} from '@tarikjabiri/dxf';

const dxf = new DxfWriter();

dxf.add3dFace(
	point3d(0, 0, 0),
	point3d(0, 100, 0),
	point3d(100, 100, 0),
	point3d(100, 0, 0),
    {
        invisibleEdges: InvisibleEdgeFlags.First | InvisibleEdgeFlags.Fourth,
    }
);
// This will make the first and fourth edges invisible.
```

:::tip

To define a 3d face with only 3 corners, make the fourth same as the third corner ðŸ˜‰.

## `IMAGE` entity

```js
import DxfWriter, {point3d, addImage} from '@tarikjabiri/dxf';

const dxf = new DxfWriter();

dxf.addImage(
	'.\\image-name.png', // Or the absolute path of the image if it isn't int the same folder.
	'image-name',
	point3d(462419.04, 576568.45, 0), // Insertion point of the bottomLeft corner of the image.
	1792, // the width of the image
	1280, // the height of the image
	1, // Scale
	0 // rotation
);
```
If you want a reference to the added image use `addImage()`.

## `INSERT` entity

It's convenient to create reusable blocks at once and use them all over the places you want.
After defining your blocks, you can insert them with the `INSERT` entity. See example code below:

```js
import DxfWriter, {point3d, addInsert} from '@tarikjabiri/dxf';

const dxf = new DxfWriter();

// Define your block
const myBlock = addBlock('block1');
myBlock.addCircle(point3d(0, 0, 0), 50);
myBlock.addRectangle(
	point2d(-35.3553, 35.3553),
	point2d(35.3553, -35.3553)
);

// Insert it when and where ever you want.
dxf.addInsert(myBlock.name, point3d(0, 0, 0));
// Or if you want a reference to the added insert.
const myInsert = addInsert(myBlock.name, point3d(0, 0, 0));
```

## `LINE` entity

```js
import DxfWriter, {point3d, addLine} from '@tarikjabiri/dxf';

const dxf = new DxfWriter();

dxf.addLine(point3d(0, 0, 0), point3d(100, 100, 0));
// Or if you want a reference to the added line.
const line = addLine(point3d(0, 0, 0), point3d(100, 100, 0));
```

## `LWPOLYLINE` entity

```js
import DxfWriter, {point3d, addLine} from '@tarikjabiri/dxf';

const dxf = new DxfWriter();

const vertices = [
	{
		point: point2d(0, 0, 0),
	},
	{
		point: point2d(100, 100, 0),
	},
	{
		point: point2d(100, 200, 0),
	},
	{
		point: point2d(0, 300, 0),
	},
];

dxf.addLWPolyline(vertices, {
	flags: LWPolylineFlags.Closed,
});

// Or if you want a reference to the added lwpolyline.
const lwpolyline = addLWPolyline(vertices);
```

## `POINT` entity

```js
import DxfWriter, {point3d, addPoint} from '@tarikjabiri/dxf';

const dxf = new DxfWriter();

dxf.addLine(point3d(0, 0, 0), point3d(100, 100, 0));
// Or if you want a reference to the added line.
const line = addLine(point3d(0, 0, 0), point3d(100, 100, 0));
```
